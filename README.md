# Geostatistical-History-Matching-Using-Machine-Learning
This section aims to show the potential of the MutliOutputRegression technique in the Machine Learning model from geostatistical simulation. We are trying to build geostatistical realizations while respecting the reservoir model with its drilling data and the experimental variogram
